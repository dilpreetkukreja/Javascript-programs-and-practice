<h2>Create Object from JSON String</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

/*A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.

When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.

Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.
*/

/*
Imagine we received this text from a web server:
'{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'
*/

var txt = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}';//its a string
//Make sure the text is written in JSON format, or else you will get a syntax error.
//Use the JavaScript function JSON.parse() to convert text into a JavaScript object:
var obj = JSON.parse(txt);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name + ", " + obj.age;
