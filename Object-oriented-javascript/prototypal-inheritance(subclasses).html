		/*Since claws and diet both exist as properties in the prototype object, they are looked up because objects are secretly linked to their constructor's prototype property.

		Great! But you may be wondering: just what is this secret link that leads to the prototype object? Right after objects are made from the PolarBear() constructor (such as snowball), they have immediate access to properties in PolarBear()'s prototype. How exactly is this possible?

		As it turns out, the secret link is snowball's __proto__ property (note the two underscores on each end). __proto__ is a property of all objects (i.e., instances) made by a constructor function, and points directly to that constructor's prototype object. Let's check out what it looks like!*/

		console.log(snowball.__proto__);

		// { claws: true, diet: 'carnivore' }
		/*Since the __proto__ property refers to the same object as PolarBear's prototype, bear, comparing them returns true:*/

		console.log(snowball.__proto__ === bear);

		// true
		/*It is highly discouraged to reassign the __proto__ property, or even use it in any code you write. */
		/*It's great to know the secret link for learning how functions and objects are interconnected, but you should not use __proto__ to manage inheritance. If you ever just need to review an object's prototype, you can still use Object.getPrototypeOf().*/
		/*ðŸ’¡ What About Just Inheriting the Prototype? ðŸ’¡
		Let's say we want a Child object to inherit from a Parent object. Why shouldn't we just set Child.prototype = Parent.prototype?

		First, recall that objects are passed by reference. This means that since the Child.prototype object and the Parent.prototype object refer to the same object -- any changes you make to Child's prototype will also be made to Parent's prototype! We don't want children being able to modify properties of their parents!

		On top of all this, no prototype chain will be set up. What if we want an object to inherit from any object we want, not just its prototype?

		We still need a way to efficiently manage inheritance without mutating the prototype at all.*/
