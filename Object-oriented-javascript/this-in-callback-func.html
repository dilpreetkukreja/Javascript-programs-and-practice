		invokeTwice2(dog.growOneYear, dog);
		console.log(dog.age);//8
		/////////more relevant solution by using bind
		/*Similar to call() and apply(), the bind() method allows us to directly define a value for this. bind() is a method that is also called _on_ a function, but unlike call() or apply(), which both invoke the function right away -- bind() returns a new function that, when called, has this set to the value we give it.*/

		///another way to solve this issue is to use an anonymous closure to close over the dog object:
		//Using this approach, invoking invokeTwice() still sets the value of this to window. However, this has no effect on the closure; within the anonymous function, the growOneYear() method will still be directly called onto the dog object!
		invokeTwice(function () {
