		/*an immediately-invoked function expression is used to immediately run a function. This function runs and returns an anonymous function that is stored in the myFunction variable.
		Note that the function that is being returned closes over (i.e., captures) the hi variable. This allows myFunction to maintain a private, mutable state that cannot be accessed outside the function! What's more: because the function expressed is called immediately, the IIFE wraps up the code nicely so that we don't pollute the global scope.

		If any of this sounds familiar -- it's because IIFE's are very closely related to everything you've learned about scope and closures!*/
