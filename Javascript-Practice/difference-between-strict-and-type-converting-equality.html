			Hereâ€™s the list of all of the falsy values:
				the Boolean value false
				the null type
				the undefined type
				the number 0
				the empty string ""
				the odd value NaN (stands for "not a number"
			Here are some other examples of truthy values:
				true
				42
				"pizza"
				"0"
				"null"
				"undefined"
				{}
				[]
			What is the difference between == and === operators?
			JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators takes type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

			1) Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
			2) Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. There are two special cases in this,
			 a) NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
			 b) Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
			3) Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
			4) Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
			5) Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e, null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

			Some of the example which covers the above cases

			0 == false   // true
			0 === false  // false
			1 == "1"     // true
			1 === "1"    // false
			null == undefined // true
			null === undefined // false
			'0' == false // true
			'0' === false // false
			[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
			{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
