		let arr1 = [1,2,3];
		let arr2 = [6,2,1];

		console.log(arr1+arr2);//"1,2,36,2,1", what happens is because of '+' sign both sides are converted into strings and then both strings are concat.

		console.log("1,3"+"2,9");//1,32,9


		//to merge two arrays

		console.log(arr1.concat(arr2));//[1,2,3,6,2,1]
		console.log(arr1);//remains unchanged
		console.log(arr2);//remains unchanged

		//another method

		let mergedArr = [...arr1, ...arr2];
