		a WeakMap does not have a .clear() method.

		/*Garbage Collection
		In JavaScript, memory is allocated when new values are created and is "automatically" freed up when those values are no longer needed. This process of freeing up memory after it is no longer needed is what is known as garbage collection.

		WeakMaps take advantage of this by exclusively working with objects as keys. If you set an object to null, then you’re essentially deleting the object. And when JavaScript’s garbage collector runs, the memory that object previously occupied will be freed up to be used later in your program.*/

		console.log(library);
		//WeakMap {Object {title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger'} => false, Object {title: 'Gulliver’s Travels', author: 'Jonathan Swift'} => true}
		/*What makes this so useful is you don’t have to worry about deleting keys that are referencing deleted objects in your WeakMaps, JavaScript does it for you! When an object is deleted, the object key will also be deleted from the WeakMap when garbage collection runs. This makes WeakMaps useful in situations where you want an efficient, lightweight solution for creating groupings of objects with metadata.*/
